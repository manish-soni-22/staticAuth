✅ Step 1: Create a Cognito User Pool
Go to the Amazon Cognito Console → https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito

Click “Create user pool”

Choose “Users” → Click “Next”

Name your pool (e.g., MyAppUserPool)

In Attributes, enable:

Email (required for web apps)

Optionally, add custom attributes like tenantId

Choose Email or Phone for user sign-in options

Configure Password policy and MFA if needed

In Message Customizations, define welcome email content

Skip advanced settings or set them as required

Click Create user pool

✅ Step 2: Create an App Client
Go to your newly created User Pool

Under App Integration → App clients and analytics, click “Create app client”

Name: myWebAppClient

Enable:

Generate client secret → ❌ (must be off for web apps)

Enable username/password auth (SRP)

Enable user SRP and custom auth flows

Save the client and note down:

App Client ID

✅ Step 3: Configure Domain for Hosted UI (optional, but helpful for quick login)
Under App Integration → Domain name

Choose a domain prefix (e.g., my-app-auth)

Save domain

You’ll get a hosted UI link like:
https://my-app-auth.auth.region.amazoncognito.com/login

✅ Step 4: Add Callback/Logout URLs
Go to App Integration → App client settings

Select the app client you created

Enable Authorization code grant and Implicit grant

Set the callback URL to your web app: e.g., https://myapp.com/callback

Set the logout URL to: https://myapp.com/logout

Choose OAuth Scopes:

email

openid

profile

Save changes

✅ Step 5: Integrate Cognito in Web App
Use Amazon Cognito Auth SDK or Amplify.

Example using Amazon Cognito Identity JS SDK:
js
Copy
Edit
import { CognitoUserPool, AuthenticationDetails, CognitoUser } from "amazon-cognito-identity-js";

const poolData = {
  UserPoolId: "us-east-1_XXXXXXX",     // Your user pool ID
  ClientId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"          // Your app client ID
};

const userPool = new CognitoUserPool(poolData);

const authenticationDetails = new AuthenticationDetails({
  Username: "user@example.com",
  Password: "UserPassword123"
});

const user = new CognitoUser({
  Username: "user@example.com",
  Pool: userPool
});

user.authenticateUser(authenticationDetails, {
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    const idToken = result.getIdToken().getJwtToken();
    console.log("JWT Token:", idToken);
    // Send JWT to API Gateway
  },
  onFailure: (err) => {
    console.error("Auth error:", err);
  }
});
✅ Step 6: Protect API Gateway Using Cognito Authorizer
Go to API Gateway → your REST or HTTP API

In Authorizers, click “Create Authorizer”

Choose Cognito

Enter:

Name: CognitoAuth

Cognito user pool: select your pool

Token source: Authorization header

Save

✅ Step 7: Attach Authorizer to API Gateway Methods
Go to your API → Resources

Choose a method (e.g., GET /device)

Click on Method Request

Set Authorization to your Cognito authorizer

Deploy the API

✅ Step 8: Call API from Web App Using JWT Token
In your frontend, after login:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch("https://api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod/devices", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: idToken // JWT from Cognito
  }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
🔄 Optional: Use Custom Claims for tenantId
Add a tenantId custom attribute during user sign-up.

Use a Pre Token Generation Lambda to include this in JWT custom claims.

Extract it in Lambda or use it in IAM policies.

Would you like a sample working web app example or help with configuring the pre-token Lambda for custom claims?
